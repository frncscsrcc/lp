lp: Go long-poll library

Note: this is a WiP and it is mainly a battlefield to improve my Golang skills.
*Use this library at your own risk*. Suggestions, bug reports and feature requests
are more than welcome.

Create a simple server

Working examples in the examples folder.

```
package main

import (
	"log"
	"net/http"
	"time"

	"github.com/frncscsrcc/lp"
)

func main() {

	// Registers a event parse function. This function is application domain
	// specific and must be provided. This function receive the body of each
	// new event request (as string) and returns a interface{}. The returned
	// value will be used as payload in the internal event structure.
	// This function is required only if you want to receive new events from
	// the REST end point
	lp.RegisterEventParser(eventParser)

	// Create a new feed
	feed1, _ := lp.NewFeed("feed1")

	// Send events generated from the server
	go simulateServerEvents(feed1)

	http.HandleFunc("/newfeed", lp.CreateFeed)
	http.HandleFunc("/newevent", lp.NotifyEvent)
	http.HandleFunc("/subscribe", lp.SubscribeHandler)
	http.HandleFunc("/listen", lp.ListenHandler)

	log.Println("Listening on port 8080")
	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
}

var eventParser = func(bodyString string) (interface{}, error) {
	// 1. decode the bodyString (eg: JSON) ...
	// ...

	// 2. Generate the payload for the new event based on business logic
	type genericObject struct {
		A string
		b string
	}

	// 3. Prepare the payload
	return genericObject{
		A: "This is A and is exported",
		b: "This is b and is not exported (you should avoid it!)",
	}, nil
}


// This function simulates new events incoming
func simulateServerEvents(feed *lp.Feed) {
	for {
		time.Sleep(10 * time.Second)
		type payload struct {
			Data string
		}
		lp.NewEvent(feed, payload{"This is some data generated by the server. It will not be parsed by the eventParse function"})
	}
}
